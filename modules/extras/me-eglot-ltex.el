;;; Commentary:

;; This file provides a hackish implementation of some of `ltex-ls' commands
;; which needs to be handled by the client.
;; See: valentjn.github.io/ltex/ltex-ls/server-usage.html#commands

;; This file implements these code actions:
;; * _ltex.addToDictionary
;; * _ltex.disableRules
;; * _ltex.hideFalsePositives

;; The custom actions are executed via an advice to `eglot-execute-command'. I
;; didn't find a direct way to register custom handler.

;; In theory, the disabled rules and custom dictionary can be saved to a word
;; list and then, they can be passed to ltex-ls as ":/path/to/dictionary.txt".
;; However, in practice, I didn't manage to get it to work with external files.
;; The workaround I use is to store them in a plist, serialize it, and load it
;; at startup. Files are stored under `eglot-ltex-user-rules-path'.

;; To use this with French for example, add something like this to the relevant
;; .dir-locals.el file:
;; ((org-mode . ((eglot-workspace-configuration . eglot-ltex-workspace-config-fn)
;;               (eglot-ltex-language . "fr"))))
