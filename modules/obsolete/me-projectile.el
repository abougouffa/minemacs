  ;; HACK: Taken from Doom Emacs
  ;; 1. Projectile uses `file-remote-p' to check for remote (tramp) paths in its
  ;;    known project list, when it automatically cleans it up on
  ;;    `projectile-mode's activation. This causes `tramp' to be loaded, which
  ;;    is quite expensive.
  ;; 2. `file-remote-p' relies on an entry in `file-name-handler-alist'
  ;;    (autoloaded by `tramp') to detect remote paths, which causes `tramp' to
  ;;    be loaded. However, we set `file-name-handler-alist' to nil at startup
  ;;    for a noteable boost in startup performance. Normally, this is not an
  ;;    issue, as I defer `projectile-mode' until well after
  ;;    `file-name-handler-alist' is restored, but it is trivial for a user to
  ;;    inadvertantly load it too early (often as part of another package that
  ;;    depends on it, or by blindly following projectile's install instructions
  ;;    and calling `projectile-mode' themselves).

  ;; In order to address both of these, I defer projectile's cleanup process
  ;; altogether. Another approach I considered was to ensure `projectile-mode'
  ;; wasn't activated until the right time, regardless of when projectile is
  ;; loaded, but this may trouble savvier Emacs users who need projectile's API
  ;; early during startup, so it needs more consideration.
