Install imaxima by unpacking the tarball and doing the usual incantation

     ./configure
     make
     make install

and put

     (autoload 'imaxima "imaxima" "Image support for Maxima." t)

in your `.emacs' file.

If you want to use imath-mode, put

     (autoload 'imath-mode "imath" "Interactive Math minor mode." t)

in your `.emacs' file, too.

To do line breaking imaxima requires the LaTeX package `breqn'. This
package is officially distributed by Morten Høgholm from:
http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/mh
as mh.zip. 

Alternatively, for the easy installation, you may download:
http://members3.jcom.home.ne.jp/imaxima/breqn097a.zip

The files in `breqn' must be installed in a place where TeX can find
them.  In a typical teTeX installation you should put the `*.sty' and
`*.sym' files in

     `/usr/share/texmf/tex/latex/breqn/'

and the documentation files in

     `/usr/share/texmf/doc/latex/breqn/'.

The files can also be installed in a number of other places - consult
your TeX documentation for details.

Now run `texhash' after installing the files.  You can use `kpsewhich'
to verify that TeX is able to find the files, e.g.

     kpsewhich breqn.sty

To get the best image quality a fairly recent version of Ghostscript
is recommended.  See the Info manaul for options suitable for using
older versions of Ghostscript or not using Ghostscript at all.

From the version 1.0 beta, imaxima and imath supports inline graph
capability. That is, special plotting commands such as wxplot2d()
can be used in imaxima and the resulted graph appears in the
*imaxima* session buffer in Emacs. Similarly, you can use the same
special plotting commands in a maxima formula in imath mode buffers.
Such formula are converted to graph image in imath mode.

To do so, you need to install GNUPLOT 4.2 or later. Your Maxima 
should be 5.12.0 or later.

Imaxima and imath are distributed from:

by Yasuaki Honda, the current maintainer of this package.
