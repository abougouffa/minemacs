  ;; Set the delay to 20s instead of the default 15. I tried using `auto', but
  ;; with the default 20 of `gcmh-auto-idle-delay-factor', it triggers GC each
  ;; 1s on my machine. Setting the factor to a higher value should solve the
  ;; issue on my machine, but I don't think it is right to assume it will work
  ;; the same way on other machines. So we switch back to a fixed delay of 20s.
