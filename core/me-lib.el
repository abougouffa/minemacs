  "MinEmacs fonts used by `+setup-fonts'.

The function checks and enables the first available font from these defined in
this plist. This variable can be customized to set font specs for specific Emacs
faces or to enable some language-specific fonts. The plist keywords are either
face names or script names expressed as keywords (with the \":\" prefix).

For example to set `default' face, use `:default', to set the `mode-line' face,
use `:mode-line', and so on. The parameters for each font in these cases (ie.
for face names) are used in the `custom-theme-set-faces' function, so you can
pass any specs (key value pairs) supported by `custom-theme-set-faces' (like
`:weight', `:slant', `:foreground', ...). A list of supported keywords are
available in the variable `+face-attributes'.

You can also setup some language-specific fonts. All scripts supported by Emacs
can be found in `+known-scripts'. The keyword in this plist will be the script
name expressed as a keyword, for example, for `latin' use `:latin', for `arabic'
use `:arabic', for `emoji' use `:emoji', and so on. In this case, the parameters
are used with `set-fontset-font', so you can send any key value pair supported
by `set-fontset-font'. A list of supported keywords in this case is available in
`+font-spec-keywords'.

The value of the extra `:prepend' keyword is passed the last argument to
`set-fontset-font'. The value of the extra `:scale' keyword can be used to set a
scaling factor for the font in Emacs' `face-font-rescale-alist'. See the
`+setup-fonts' implementation for more details."
