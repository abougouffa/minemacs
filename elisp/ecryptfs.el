;;; Commentary:

;; This allows me to mount my private directory encrypted using ecryptfs-utils.
;; It is a port of "ecryptfs-mount-private" shell command. It extracts the
;; encryption key from a GPG encrypted file containing the eCryptfs password.
;; The decryption of the password is performed using Emacs' `epg'.
